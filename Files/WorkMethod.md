# Work Methodology

We used a combination of Scrum and Waterfall. We decided to be focused on one artifact among all, but at the same time start with research or minimal knowledge of the other artifacts that were not being carried out.

This helped us to have constant progress of things and teamwork.

From Scrum, we used repetition and constant review of the work to see if all the artifacts matched instead of contradicting each other.

From Waterfall, we used the fact of going from artifact to artifact so that all team members were aware of how to perform the artifact. 

This set was seen as beneficial so that we all learned how to improve our skills and knowledge in creating the artifacts in an ideal way and the correct decision-making in the face of different points of view.
